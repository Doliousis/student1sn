## About Me
My name is Brian Snipes, a student at Del Norte High School. Ever since I had access to the internet, I was completely amazed at what it could accomplish and the good it could do for people (as well as its culture and different forms of games and media), so I became interested in learning how computers and other mediums of technology operate; which is my motivation for selecting this class as an elective. I am also an avid badminton enthusiast, and plan on joining the team in the Spring. I cosnider myself to be a relatively creative individual, and look forward to seeing what I can make in this class!
